        "db.users.delete_one({ name: \"Alice\" })\n",
        "\n",
        "This would remove the first document in the \"users\" collection that has a name field with the value \"Alice\".\n",
        "\n",
        "delete_many(): This method removes all documents from a collection that match the specified filter. This can be useful when you want to delete multiple documents at once.\n",
        "For example, if you have a collection of orders and you want to delete all orders that were placed before a certain date, you could use the following code:\n",
        " \n",
        "\n",
        "db.orders.delete_many({ order_date: { $lt: ISODate(\"2022-01-01\") } })\n",
        "This would remove all documents in the \"orders\" collection that have an \"order_date\" field with a value less than \"2022-01-01\".\n",
        "\n",
        "drop(): This method removes an entire collection from the database. This is different from the previous methods, which only remove documents from a collection.\n",
        "For example, if you want to completely remove a collection of users, you could use the following code:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "db.users.drop()\n",
        "This would remove the entire \"users\" collection from the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that these methods permanently delete data from the database, so it's recommended to use them with caution and make sure to double-check your filters before executing them."
