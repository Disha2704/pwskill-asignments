        "Use specific exception classes: It is best to use specific exception classes whenever possible, rather than catching all exceptions with a generic Exception catch block. Specific exceptions provide more detailed information about the error, which can make it easier to identify and fix the issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: Exceptions should be handled at the appropriate level of the code. For example, if an error occurs within a function, the exception should be caught and handled within the function, rather than being propagated up to the calling code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use finally blocks: The finally block is used to define a set of statements that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. This block is commonly used to release resources, such as closing files or database connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Provide meaningful error messages: When raising exceptions or catching them, it is important to provide meaningful error messages that describe the cause of the error. This can help to identify and fix the problem more quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use context managers: Context managers are a convenient way to handle resources, such as files and database connections, and can help to ensure that they are properly closed or released when they are no longer needed."
